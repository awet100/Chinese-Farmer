        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q class="neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">maybe</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">maybe</q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <em value="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">maybe</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">maybe</q></p>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em value="good">good</em> or <em value="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
