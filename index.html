    <h2>preamble</h2>

        <li>read this once</li>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</blockquote> The farmer said, <blockquote>Maybe.</blockquote> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <blockquote>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote>Maybe.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote>Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>,</blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote>Maybe.</blockquote> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote>Isn’t that great!</blockquote> Again, he said, <blockquote>Maybe.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.</p> <br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
